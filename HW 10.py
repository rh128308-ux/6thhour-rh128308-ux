#1. Print "Hello World!"

print("Hello World!")

#2. Create 3 variables that each randomly generate a number between 1 and 10, named A, B, and C.

A = random.randint(1,10)
B = random.randint(1,10)
C = random.randint(1,10)

#3. Print A, B, and C on the same line.

print(A,B,C)

#4. Make an if statement that prints if variable A is greater than, less than, or equal to 5.
if A > 5:
    print("A is greater than 5")
elif A == 5:
    print("A is equal to 5")
elif A < 5:
    print("A is less than 5")

#5. Make an if statement that prints if variable B is between 3 and 7, or not.

if 3 < B < 7:
    print("B is between 3 and 7")

else:
    print("B is not between 3 and 7")

#6. Make an if statement that prints if variable C is even or odd.

if C%2 == 0:
    print("C is even")
else:
    print("C is odd")

#7. Create a variable whose value is 3 + a randomly generated number between 1 and 20

D = random.randint(1,20) + 3

#8. Make an if statement that prints if the variable from #7 is greater than, less than, or equal to A + B + C.

E = A + B + C

if D < E :
    print("D is smaller than A + B + C")
elif D > E:
    print("D is greater than A + B + C")
elif D == E:
    print("D is equal to A + B + C")
